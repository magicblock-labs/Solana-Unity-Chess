# Solana Unity Chess

Solana Unity Chess is a #d Chess game built using Unity/C# and the Solana.Unity-SDK.
Unity is used as UI/Rendering, the Solana.Unity-SDK is the interface and the state/logic is on-chain (on Solana).

This repository was created with the purpose of demostrating the use of the [Solana.Unity-SDK](https://solana.unity-sdk.gg/).
